                In my personal opinion, this movie is one of the best movies of all time, I have never had a movie make me go through so many emotions. 
                In the 2 1/2 hours runtime, this movie made me Excited, Sad, Angry, Hopeful, and Happy. 
                This movie also has one the best plots for a movie ive ever seen.

                I Think that Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gave career defining performances, both of them act like real people.
                 They both have their own asperations and goals, within the movie we see their goals change over the 20ish years we follow Andy in prison. 
                 The ending is perfect for this movie, some movies have bad endings but this movie was perfect. 10/10
