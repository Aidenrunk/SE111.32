            <h1> Review of The Shawshank Redemption</h1>

            <h4>In My personal opinion, this movie is one of the best movies of all time, I have never had a movie make me go through so many emotions. In the 2 1/2 hours, this movie made me , Excited, Sad, Angry, Hopeful, and Happy. 
                This movie also has one the best plots for a movie ive ever seen, when banker Andy Dufrense is falsly imprisoned for the murder of his wife, he uses his intellect to his advantange in prison.</h4>
